# Work project on Robotic Process Automation

This repo contains UiPath scripts designed for the automation of routine invoices processing (with data on the arrival of goods in a clothing store) for its future use in accounting.

The main result of this work is two automated scenarios for processing invoices developed for more efficient accounting.
The robots have already been tested in a real environment and save an average of _*7 man-hours*_ in _*30 seconds*_ of operation.
